# AgentX OpenProbe

## üöÄ Getting Started


## ‚ú® Features

* **Automated Planning**: Breaks down complex queries into multiple sub-queries for efficient searching.
* **Adaptive Replanning**: Revises search strategies when initial plans fall short (up to 2 replans).
* **Reflection**: Explains why previous plans failed and how they were improved.
* **Web Search Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with multiple search APIs for information retrieval.

## üß≠ How It Works

1. Analyzes the user‚Äôs question.
2. Generates a search plan with multiple sub-queries.
3. Executes searches based on the plan.
4. If results are insufficient, replans up to 2 times with improved queries.
5. Synthesizes information into a final, comprehensive answer.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Usage

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Configure API Keys

Create a `.env` file inside the `openprobe` directory and add your API keys:

```bash
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
LAMBDA_API_KEY=your_lambda_api_key
WEB_SEARCH_API_KEY=your_serper_dev_api_key
JINA_API_KEY=your_jina_api_key
MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_mistral_api_key
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies

Run the following commands to set up your environment:

```bash
cd openprobe
pip install -e .
crawl4ai-setup
crawl4ai-doctor
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Run a Single Query

Test the system with a single question:

```bash
python test_deepsearch.py
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Run Evaluation on FRAMES

Evaluate on the FRAMES dataset:

```bash
python evals/eval_tasks.py \
    --eval-tasks ./evals/datasets/frames_custom_set.csv \
    --parallel-workers 8
```

After completion, the evaluation results will be saved as a `.jsonl` file in the `output` directory.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Run Auto Grading

Grade the evaluation results using LLM auto-grading:

```bash
python evals/autograde_df.py \
    PATH_TO_RESULT_JSONL_FILE \
    --provider mistral \
    --num_cpus 2
```

The grading output will be appended to the input `.jsonl` file.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Compute Accuracy

Calculate accuracy on an experiment result:

```bash
python evals/accuracy.py \
    PATH_TO_GRADED_JSONL_FILE
```
